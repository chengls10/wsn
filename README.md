网络测量课程：wsn数据分析和可视化
=================================
In this project, you will be provided the measurement data from a real deployed wireless sensor network (WSN) CitySee, an outdoor WSN in the urban area. The data will be self-contained with the corresponding data format. The collected data contains the routing information, node statistic information, environment information and etc. Based on the provided data, you have the following tasks.

1. Understand the data and basic concepts of WSNs. You also need to understand the basic routing protocols in wireless sensor networks (ref to many Internet routing protocols and CTP[1]).
2. Analyze the basic network properties, e.g., the packet reception ratio for different types of packets, the packet reception rate. You may need to figure out a good way to flexibly show a particular property in different time scales (e.g., in 1 hour, 2 hour, 1 day and etc).

3. Based on the location data, show the location of different sensor nodes. Based on the parent information in the data, plot a snapshot of the routing topology for the first day.
4. Analyze the basic statistics of the routing topology. Design a tool to show the topology evolution for the provided data, i.e., the topology change over time. Show the statistical results of topology evolution, e.g., how many link have changed, the location of the change, the distribution of the change, is there any correlation for changes at different locations and time? Here you may need to find your way the present the result.

5. Based on the temperature and humidity data, show the change of the temperature and humidity data.
6. To further find information from the collected data, try to reveal the impact of temperature and humidity to the network?
