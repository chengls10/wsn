C1 packet: 

It includes two kinds of information: 1) sensing readings, such as humidity, temperature and light. 2) path information : It records the node IDs along a routing path toward the sink. If one packet's path length exceeds 10, it only records the first 10 node IDs starting from the source node(exclude the source node ID).

Fields:

0  PacketReceivedTimestamp(sink view): 	the timestamp when the packet is received at the sink

1  PacketType: packet type (C1 or C2 or C3)

2  SourceID: the source node ID which gerenates the packet

3  SinkID: the destination node ID which collects the data

4  Parent: the parent node ID

5  Humidity: 	 raw data (Conversion formula refers to [1])

6  Temperature:  raw data (Conversion formula refers to [1])

7  Light:        raw data (Conversion formula refers to [1])

8  PathLength:   the length of routing path 

9 .. 18 PathNodes[10]: the node IDs along the routing path. It records the first 10 node IDs from the source node at most(exclude the source node ID) 

###############################################################################

C2: packet:

It contains the routing table with a preconfigured maximum size of 10. Each routing entry includes the neighbor node ID, the RSSI value from the neighbor, the link-ETX, and the path-ETX.

Fields:

0  PacketReceivedTimestamp(sink view): the timestamp when the packet is received at the sink

1  PacketType: packet type (C1 or C2 or C3)

2  SourceID: the source node ID which gerenates the packet

3  SinkID:   the destination node ID which collects the data

4  Parent: the parent node ID

5  NeighborTableSize: routing table size

   NeighborEntry NeighborInformationTable[10]: routing table

   struct NeighborEntry 
   {
	ID: the neighbor node ID                   6,9 .. ,33
	RSSI: the RSSI value from the neighbor     7,10 ..,34
	PathETX: the path ETX                      8,11 ..,35
   }
